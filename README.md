*Abstract* -Nowadays, IoT represents an important mainstream in everyday life. Many diverse
companies and areas of human life rely on inter-connectivity between devices for a
more efficient, productive and competitive society. The Global Positioning System
(GPS) is widely spread and now standard for an accurate outdoor positioning.
However, there is not yet a standard when we talk about indoor positioning system
(IPS). IPS are a highly demanded field for different purposes; starting from accurate
indoor positioning of certain objects or humans up to precision tracking.
An extensive research has been carried out regarding IPS, and proposals of
technologies such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee and ultra wideband radio have been
tested. Among these none have made it into being marked as the standard, until
the introduction of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. BLE offers a wide of
promises and abilities seen through low-energy, low cost, usability and compatibility
with other wireless communication systems. This Master thesis is based on the
investigation of the utilization of BLE technology for accurate indoor positioning.
The Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values of the BLE signal are being
investigated with different approaches known in the scientific society. A selection of
algorithms from Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Networks is selected to be tested,
explored and evaluated on the given dataset. In particular, LSTM is shown as the
approach utilized with highest accuracy for indoor positioning. The results obtained
are being analyzed and compared to the known values of previously developed
models of ML algorithms. This discussion concludes with showing that BLE is a
very reliable technique for accurate indoor positioning. Additionally, the report
shows some of the encountered pitfalls of the technology and approaches, as well as
further work plans.
